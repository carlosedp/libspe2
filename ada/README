Usage of Ada binding package files

There are three Ada binding package files under this directory: 
cbea_map.ads, libspe2_types.ads and libspe2.ads. The cbea_map.ads and libspe2_types.ads declare data types, data structures and constants used in libspe2 API. The libspe.ads defines all interfaces of libspe functions using Ada pragmas. 

To include the package files in Ada source file:
	with cbea_map.ads;
	with libspe_types.ads;
	with libspe.ads;
Further more to have full visibility of the data and interfaces:
	use cbea_map.ads;
	use libspe_types.ads;
	use libspe.ads

The Ada binding package files are installed under /usr/adainclude in SDK 3.0.
You need to set this directory in your source path so that the compiler could find the packages. 
For instance in your GNAT project file hello.gpr:
Project hello is
	 for Source_Dirs use("/usr/adainclude/", ".");
end hello;

When compiling the Ada source program, add a GNAT option -Phello.gpr.
e.g.
ppu-gnatmake helloworld.adb -Phello.gpr 

The libspe2.ads file is linked with libspe dynamic library automatically through Linker_Options pragma.
