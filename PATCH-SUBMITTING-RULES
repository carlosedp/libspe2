How to submit your patches against libspe


* Contributing to the project

  In libspe project, only the project maintainers have write access to
  the repository and other developers are encouraged to contribute
  their changes to the project via patches posted to a mailing
  list. This document shows such contributors how to create and post
  their patches.


* Creating patches

  Create your patches by the following rules:

  - Generate patches in the following format:

    - Use "diff -uprN" to generate patches.

    - The patches should be created one directory higher than the root
      source directory of libspe, i.e. the created patches should be
      applied by "patch -p1" in the root directory of libspe.

    e.g.)

      SHELL> tar xvfz libspe2-2.1.0.tar.gz
      SHELL> mv libspe2-2.1.0 libspe2-2.1.0.orig
      SHELL> diff -uprN libspe2-2.1.0.orig libspe2-2.1.0.mine > my.patch

    NOTE) The recent versions of Quilt generate patches in the
          required format by default.

    NOTE) Subversion and CVS can generate diffs in the required
          format as following:

            Subversion: svn diff --diff-cmd diff -x -up libspe2
            CVS:        cvs diff -upN libspe2

          Some of the options above can be specified in your
          configuration files as default behaviors. See manuals for
          details.

  - Generate patches against the latest release or against the latest
    revision (or one of the recent revisions) in the public
    repository.

    NOTE) The public repository is available at
          "http://sourceforge.net/projects/libspe/".

  - Add explanation for your changes to the patches.

  - Sign the patches.

    Put your sign on the patches, if you can certify the below:

        Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

            in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
